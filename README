# SilverSteam

This is a relatively simple page, that works as an alternative interface for [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/). Unlike its predecessor [DarkSteam](https://github.com/Simbiat/DarkSteam) this page does not allow to download anything but .acf and .manifest files if they are present.

## Usage

### Setup
Essentially all you need to do is place the files to your server. Well, almost, since you need to create database first.

For convinience, there is a `structure_sql.sql` file to create related tables. To get you started there is also `data_sql.sql` which also has data as seen [here](http://simbiat.net/ssc).

Then setup database connection in `config.sample.php`, rename it to `config.php` and you will have a working site.

### Acquiring new data
Unlike with DarkSteam, SilverSteam relies solemnly on Steam API, so you do not need to do anything You may be able to even find some newer games on the live version of the site.

# Important notice
This project is not actively supported, but if any bugs are found, I will see what I can do to fix them. Main updates will be done only to add comments to some portions of the code
